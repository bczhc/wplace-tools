## Creating incremental deltas

As an example: there are two world archives retrieved
from [wplace-archives](https://github.com/murolem/wplace-archives):

```
5.0G	2025-09-04T10-21-29.961Z+2h59m (1)
5.2G	2025-09-04T13-20-46.618Z+3h0m (2)
```

For creating an incremental backup of (2), with (1) as its parent, do:

```shell
parent='2025-09-04T10-21-29.961Z+2h59m'
archive='2025-09-04T13-20-46.618Z+3h0m'
cargo run -r --bin archive-tool -- diff "$parent" "$archive" ./diff
```

A compression needs to be done. This
significantly reduces disk space.

```console
tar -c diff | pigz > diff.tgz
‚ùØ du -sh diff.tgz
72M	diff.tgz
```

Now we only have a 72M incremental data pack.

## Applying incremental data

First extract all diff files.

```shell
tar -xzf diff.tgz
```

Then apply the changes.

```shell
parent='2025-09-04T10-21-29.961Z+2h59m'
archive='2025-09-04T13-20-46.618Z+3h0m'
cargo run -r --bin archive-tool -- apply "$parent" ./diff "$archive"
```

Archive `2025-09-04T13-20-46.618Z+3h0m` will be restored.

## Tile number to lat/lng

   ```shell
   bun run tile-to-coord.js <tile-x> <tile-y>
   ```
